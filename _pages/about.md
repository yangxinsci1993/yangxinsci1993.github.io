I am currently a research fellow in Department of Food Science and Technology, National University of Singapore. My current research task is isolation and characterization of natural products from *Antrodia camphorata*, and verification of their bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and anti-viral activities.

I graduated from Northwest A&F University with a bachelor’s degree in 2015, and my supervisor for final year project is [**Dr. Wang Jianlong**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianlong-Wang-5). After that, I went to National University of Singapore for my Ph.D. degree, advised by [**Dr. Huang Dejian**](https://www.fst.nus.edu.sg/our_people/faculty-members/huang-dejian/). In my research journey in Singapore, I also have deep collaboration with [**Dr. Houk**](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/houk/) from UCLA, [**Dr. Liu Fang**](https://cos.njau.edu.cn/info/1074/2548.htm) from Nanjing Agricultural University and [**Dr. Sun Chenghua**](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=chenghuasun) from Swinburne University of Technology. [**Dr. Liu Xiaogang**](https://liuxg.science.nus.edu.sg/head/), [**Dr. Wu Jie**](https://www.wujiegroupnus.com/team), [**Dr. Chi Chunyan**](https://chichunyan.webs.com/), [**Dr. Yang Hongshun**](https://www.fst.nus.edu.sg/our_people/faculty-members/yang-hongshun/) were my thesis advisory committee members and gave me a lot of valuable guidances on my research.

My research interest includes **(1) Synthesis of bioactive compounds**, **(2) Nature products**, **(3) luminescent molecular and nanoprobes** and **（4）Chemical principles of antioxidants**. I have published papers at the top research journals including *Nature Communication*, *Biosensors and Bioelectronics*, *Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical*, *Green Chemistry*, *Organic letters*, *Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry* et al., with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1fXM4wUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>26+</span></strong></a> (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1fXM4wUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1fXM4wUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>1000+</span></strong></a>

I was nominated as topic editor for muti-journal topic, [Bioactive Compounds with Application Potentials in Nutraceuticals and Nutricosmetics: Focus on Mechanism of Action and Application Science](https://www.mdpi.com/topics/S8VZUEHT3B#journals). This topic is now open for submission.

I like basketball and guitar. I formed a band, Handsome Boys (帅比乐队), as lead guitarist when I was undergraduate student. And we even have an invited performances in our graduation ceremony.

- The reaction products of five flavonoids (apigenin, quercetin, naringenin, ampelopsin, and epicatechin) with hypochlorous acid and found that primary chlorination reaction occurred on the A-ring (C6 or C8) and/or C-rings but not on B-rings were characterized. 
- The hydroxyl groups in the A-ring and B-ring can enhance the scavenging capacity, whereas the C(2)C(3) double bond has a negative impact on the HClO scavenging capacity.
